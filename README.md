# React & Redux TodoList

React, Redux, Brunch and Jest.

App heavily based on work done by [@sharifsbeat](https://twitter.com/sharifsbeat) in his post named [_The Elegance Of React_](https://medium.com/javascript-inside/the-elegance-of-react-ebc21a2dcd19#.58v8me4px) and the video series of [@kentcdodds](https://twitter.com/kentcdodds) in egghead.io about Jest named [_Testing JavaScript with Jest_](https://egghead.io/playlists/testing-javascript-with-jest-a36c4074).

The main purpose of this app is to show the integration of the tools listed above, specially the usage of Brunch and Jest.

  npm start
    brunch watch --server
  npm test
